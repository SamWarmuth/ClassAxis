I called this lazybones because cute names are important in the ruby world. 

Lazybones = (Monk) skeleton on Couch(db). Or something. Gimme a break.

Unlike the main monk skeleton, I didn't commit the contents of the vendor directory.

Instead, after you check out the skeleton, be sure to use the dep tool to build them.


dep vendor --all


Also, open config/settings.yml and change the CouchDB database name(s) to reflect your set-up.

TODO, requests for help - stuff I would like to add:

1. A task to do some env/variable injection/interpolation. For example, a tool to inject an app name into the settings.yml file.
2. Support for memcached out of the box to cache the results of CouchDB lookups.
