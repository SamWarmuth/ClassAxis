Mockup at http://www.slidemirror.com/show/d2z#3

Conversations: more like a forum than a chat.  Threaded responses.
  Trees rather than threads.
  How do we want to show this on a page?  After a few nests, the text gets really skinny and annoying to read.
  Each post has a permalink.

Calendar
  For events, assignments, tests
  Be able to compare schedules  (a la tungle.me)
  Google Calendar embed?  (.ics)

Chat
  Single and Group Chats?
  Persistent Chat Rooms? (like how campfireâ€™s chat rooms work)

Classes
  Automatic assigned and grouped with people in your class
