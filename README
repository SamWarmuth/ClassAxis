Mockup at http://www.slidemirror.com/show/d2z#3

Conversations: more like a forum than a chat.  Threaded responses.
Probably will want them to be essentially like a tree, rather than just one thread.
How do we want to show this on a page?  After a few nests, the text gets really skinny and annoying to read.
Could link to post numbers a la 4chan

Calendar
For events, assignments, tests
Be able to compare schedules  (  tungle.me  )
Google Calendar embed?  (  .ics   )

Chat
Single and Group Chats?
Persistent Chat Rooms? (like how campfireâ€™s chat rooms [top-left of image] work)

Classes
Automatic assigned and grouped with people in your class
